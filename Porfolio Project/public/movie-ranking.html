<h1>The Best Movies According to Tanya</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>Cult Classic! You will learn a lot about modern society based on this one. The best part is its analogue of the WWII</p>

<h3>Star Trek</h3>
<p>Another Cult Classic! Built maybe as an attempted sequel of what intergalictic society would look like post Star Wars.<br /> The Federation is the hope for what our Society could look like.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>A wonderful story of adventure, brotherhood and fighting for something bigger than yourself. <br /> It inspires us to do more.</p>
